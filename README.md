# 🕵️‍♂️ Deepfake Image Detection V3

A state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detection system designed to distinguish between real and AI-generated images with **99.13% AUC**.

This project utilizes a **Dual-Stream Gated Architecture** that simultaneously analyzes high-level visual features (faces, expressions) and low-level forensic artifacts (GAN fingerprints, noise patterns), making it robust against high-quality Deepfakes (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DeepFaceLab).

## Key Features

* **Dual-Stream Architecture:** Combines a **MobileNetV2** backbone (Visual Stream) with custom **SRM & Bayar Conv layers** (Forensic Stream).
* **Adaptive Gating:** A learned gating mechanism dynamically weights the importance of visual vs. forensic features for each image.
* **Mobile Optimized:** Ultra-lightweight design (~4.02M parameters) compatible with **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** for edge deployment (4.36 MB file size).
* **"Wild" Generalization:** Proven capability to detect unseen, real-world viral deepfakes (e.g., Rashmika Mandanna, Jake Gyllenhaal) with >96% confidence.
* **Robust Training:** Trained on a diverse mix of **CIFAKE**, **FaceForensics++**, and **Celeb-DF** datasets to prevent overfitting to specific artifacts.

## Performance Metrics (V3)

Evaluated on a held-out test set of 23,564 images.

| Metric | Score | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AUC-ROC** | **0.9913** | Exceptional separation between Real and Fake classes. |
| **Accuracy** | **94.78%** | Overall correctness on the test dataset. |
| **Precision** | **93.46%** | Low false positive rate (rarely calls a real image "Fake"). |
| **Recall** | **96.21%** | High sensitivity (catches 96% of deepfakes). |
| **F1-Score** | **0.9481** | Balanced performance between precision and recall. |

## Model Architecture

The model uses a **V3 Dual-Stream approach**:

1. **Visual Stream (RGB):** Uses `MobileNetV2` to extract semantic features (eyes, mouth, facial structure).
2. **Forensic Stream (Noise):** Uses a custom `SRMLayer` (Spatial Rich Model) and `BayarConv2D` to suppress image content and isolate noise residuals (pixel-level artifacts).
3. **Fusion & Gating:** The two streams are concatenated and weighted by a gating network before the final classification head.

## Installation & Usage

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd deepfake-backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start API Server

```bash
cd deepfake-backend
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup (requires Node.js 20+)

```bash
cd deepfake-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Run Training (V3)

```bash
cd deepfake-backend
python -c "from src.models.train_model import main; main()"
```

### Run Inference (Single Image)

```bash
cd deepfake-backend
python tests/test_predict.py
```

Or via API:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" -F "file=@test_images/test1.jpeg"
```



## Mobile Deployment

The model is fully compatible with TensorFlow Lite.

* **Float32 Size:** 15.53 MB
* **Quantized Size:** 4.36 MB

To evaluate real-world edge deployment viability beyond desktop emulation, we con-
ducted empirical benchmarking directly on physical mobile hardware. Tests were
executed on a commercial smartphone powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1200
System-on-Chip (SoC) using the native C++ TensorFlow Lite benchmark binary
across 4 CPU threads with the XNNPACK delegate.
